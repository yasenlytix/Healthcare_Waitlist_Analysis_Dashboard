## 😫 Problem To Focus
#### **☑️ Rising Wait List:-** The Latest month’s total wait list is 709K, increased from 640K last year — showing a clear backlog trend.
#### **☑️ Long Waiting Periods:-** Over 415 cases are waiting for 18+ months, indicating serious delays in patient treatment.
#### **☑️ Age Group Imbalance:-** A large portion of waitlisted patients are aged 0–15, raising concerns about delayed care for children.
#### **☑️ Case Type Pressure:-** 72.49% of all cases are Outpatient, highlighting an overloaded outpatient system needing process improvements.

## 😫 Steps to Uncover

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Cleaning
#### I started by collecting raw data from XLSX files. Cleaned it in Power Query, fixed missing values, removed errors, and filtered the needed date range (Jan 2018 to Mar 2021).
